## My Process

This project focuses on creating an engaging and responsive landing page for Room with modern design and interactive features. Key aspects include a responsive layout, lazy loading of images, and a functional slider. The project uses BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for CSS organization and vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Utilized semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS:** Employed custom properties (variables) for consistent styling, Flexbox and Grid for layout, and BEM for CSS structure.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented lazy loading for images and interactive features such as sliders and navigation.

### BEM Methodology

In this project, the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology was used to structure the CSS, improving maintainability and readability. Here’s how BEM was applied:

- **Block:** Represents the main components (e.g., `.header`, `.footer`, `.slider`).
- **Element:** Represents a part of a block (e.g., `.header__logo`, `.slider__button`).
- **Modifier:** Represents variations or states of blocks or elements (e.g., `.header--dark`, `.slider__button--active`).

#### Example BEM Structure

- **Header Block:**

  ```scss
  .header {
    // Block styles

    &__logo {
      // Element styles
    }

    &__nav {
      // Element styles
    }

    &--dark {
      // Modifier styles
    }
  }
  ```

- **Slider Block:**

  ```scss
  .slider {
    // Block styles

    &__card {
      // Element styles
    }

    &__button {
      // Element styles
    }

    &--active {
      // Modifier styles
    }
  }
  ```

### What I Learned

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in:

- **HTML Semantics:** Structuring HTML to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Using CSS variables for dynamic and consistent styling.
- **SCSS:** Applying SCSS for modular and maintainable CSS.
- **BEM Methodology:** Organizing CSS with BEM for better readability and scalability.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing lazy loading and interactive features with vanilla JavaScript.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizing Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts.

### Continued Development

Future updates may include:

- **Advanced JavaScript:** Implementing more sophisticated JavaScript techniques for improved performance.
- **Enhanced CSS Animations:** Adding complex animations and transitions to enrich user experience.
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Ensuring all interactive elements are fully accessible and improving keyboard navigation.
